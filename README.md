Spring Boot and React Contact API
This project is a Contact API created with Spring Boot and React. Through this API, users will have a simple interface to create, read, update, and delete contact information such as customers, contacts, etc.

Project Structure
The project consists of two main parts:

Spring Boot Backend: The backend part is written in Java and utilizes Spring Data JPA with useful models and repositories. Spring MVC is used to handle incoming HTTP requests and provide responses.

React Frontend: The frontend part is written with modern React and utilizes libraries like Material-UI and Axios. All operations (adding, reading, updating, deleting data) are performed via RESTful API calls.
